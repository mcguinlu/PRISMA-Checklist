The PRISMA 2020 statement is intended to facilitate transparent reporting of systematic reviews (with or without meta-analysis). It has been designed primarily for systematic reviews of studies that evaluate the effects of health interventions, irrespective of the design of included studies. However, the checklist items are applicable also to reports of systematic reviews evaluating other (non-health-related) interventions and systematic reviews with objectives other than evaluating interventions. 

The PRISMA 2020 statement comprises a 27-item checklist addressing the introduction, methods, results and discussion sections of a systematic review report, and a 12-item checklist for the abstract. Once users record a response for each item in the checklist(s) below, they can generate and download a report of their completed checklist in Word or PDF format.
