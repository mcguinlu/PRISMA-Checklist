The PRISMA 2020 statement is intended to facilitate transparent reporting of systematic reviews (with or without meta-analysis). It has been designed primarily for systematic reviews of studies that evaluate the effects of health interventions, irrespective of the design of the included studies. However, the checklist items are applicable to reports of systematic reviews evaluating other non-health-related interventions (e.g. social or educational interventions), and many items are applicable to systematic reviews with objectives other than evaluating interventions (e.g. evaluating aetiology, prevalence or prognosis). PRISMA 2020 is intended for use in systematic reviews that include synthesis (e.g. pairwise meta-analysis, or other synthesis methods), or do not include synthesis (e.g. because only one eligible study is identified). 

The PRISMA 2020 statement comprises a 27-item checklist addressing the introduction, methods, results and discussion sections of a systematic review report, and a 12-item checklist for the abstract. Once users record a response for each item in the checklist(s) below, they can generate and download a report of their completed checklist in Word or PDF format.
