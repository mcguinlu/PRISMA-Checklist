# TRANSPARENCY CHECKLIST

This is a public repository of the consensus-based transparency checklist developed by Aczel, et al. (2019).

### What is the Transparency Checklist?

The Transparency Checklist is a comprehensive checklist that researchers can use to improve and document the transparency of their research. This checklist was developed for social and behavioral scientists who conduct and report confirmatory research on primary data. Nevertheless, several of the checklist items may also be relevant for other approaches and disciplines. 

### Where to find the Transparency Checklist?

The transparency checklist is available online at http://www.shinyapps.org/apps/TransparencyChecklist/. The short version of the checklist is available at http://www.shinyapps.org/apps/ShortTransparencyChecklist/.

### How to use it?

- The checklist refers to a single study of interest.
- Please respond to each checklist item. If necessary, you can provide an explanation at the end of each section. 
- When the question refers to your manuscript, this includes all supplementary materials and appendices that are relevant to the study of interest.
- After all the questions have been answered, you can generate a transparency report for your study by pressing the button labeled GENERATE REPORT at the bottom of the page. 
- Save your transparency report on your computer. Note that after you download your report, your responses on the checklist will not be saved by our webpage.
- Upload your transparency report to a public repository.
