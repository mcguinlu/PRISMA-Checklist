# PRISMA 2020 Checklist App

The PRISMA 2020 statement is intended to facilitate transparent
reporting of systematic reviews (with or without meta-analysis). It has
been designed primarily for systematic reviews of studies that evaluate
the effects of health interventions, irrespective of the design of
included studies. However, the checklist items are applicable also to
reports of systematic reviews evaluating other (non-health-related)
interventions and systematic reviews with objectives other than
evaluating interventions.

The PRISMA 2020 statement comprises a 27-item checklist addressing the
introduction, methods, results and discussion sections of a systematic
review report, and a 12-item checklist for the abstract. This app
provides a user-friendly way to produce PRISMA checklists. Once users record
a response for each item, they can generate and download a report of their
completed checklist in Word or PDF format.

The app is available at:
